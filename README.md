  - Looking back at ones code can show you just how far you have come. Sparked by a conversation between Ben Baldwin (@benbaldwin), Patrick and Ellis, this weeks episode is on code review and refactoring. Ben went into his past and has furnished a set of code for us to try to refactor. In the spirit of things, neither of us looked closely at the code ahead of time, and recorded our initial reactions and process of refactoring Bens code into a function that could be applied to multiple datasets!

  - This week we reflect back on the past year and combine techniques from multiple episodes. We scrape multiuple tables from the the hockey reference website, use regular expressions to clean and organize the data, and use for loops to determine the optimal pythagorean win exponent.  We visualize the data using several different techniques, like scatter and lollipop charts. We show some fun tools with regularizing values for linear regressions and how how to predict and visualize the results.

  - This week we play with a new technique for optimizing, the `optim` function! We scrape the 2019-2020 NHL season to generate power rankings for every NHL team and home-ice-edge. We can use this to then predict team winning probability! We then combine that with season summary data to generate a pretty GT table!

- [Episode 49: MLB Batting Simulations](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep49)
  
  - We continue looking at simulations this week, but this time for individual players. Using {Lahman}, we pull the 2019 MLB player batting stats, and visualize the stats using histograms and density plots. Next, to generate confidence intervals around their batting averages we use rbinom() combined with techniques from the {tidyverse} to make simulation easy. Finally we visualize the data using {gt} combined with {sparklines}.

- [Episode 50: MLB Batting Simulations](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep50)
  
  - Another MLB Batting episode. This time we use the James Stein Estimator (paper below) to apply a shrinkage estimate to player batting averages to get a "true" estimate, removing luck. Using {Lahman}, we pull the 2018 MLB player batting stats, and explain how to implement the estimator. Next, we compare estimates against the 2019 season. Finally we visualize the data using {gt}, using header spans, and cell styling. For the grand finale we combine this gt table with batting averages with plots using patchwork!.

- [Episode 51: Deploying Models with Shiny](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep51)
  
  - Sharing the results of a modeling effort is an important skill of any data scientist. However, just sharing the weights of each predictory is often not good enough to get buy in from stakeholders who are understandably skeptical of your results. Using the power of shiny, you can show your stakeholders exactly how your model interprets and then predicts the results. In this episode, we use the {palmerpenguins} package with {randomforest} to generate a model to predict the species of a new penguin.

- [Episode 98: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Sampling and Bootstraps](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep98)

  - `sample` is a fun and useful base R function that allows you to select a sample of n values from a vector at random. This has important implications to setting up bootstap sets to resample existing datasets. This week we go through the differences between simulation and resampling and how to do some simple set ups to resampling that will be the foundation to the next few episodes.

- [Episode 99: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Basic Bayes](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep99)

  - Applying what we have learned these last few weeks, we are ready for Bayesian Statistics and Bayes theorem! This week we work through the concept behind Bayes, and attempt to talk through it in more approachable terms. We then try to apply the theorem to a few different cases to help solidify our understanding.

- [Episode 100: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Beta Bayes](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep100)

  - Continuing our series on bayes, this week we learn about the conjugate prior of the binomial distribution, the beta distributions! Applying what we have learned about bayes theorem last week, we work through an example where we are trying to evaluate the performance of a basketball player in a drill where the average participant hits 65% of their shots, and this person hit 16 of 20. We discuss how to calculate some credible intervals, and update our analysis as we get more data on this player!

- [Episode 101: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Poisson/Gamma](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep101)

  - Ever wonder how you could estimate the probability of a rate? Well, enter the Poisson distribution. Armed with "lambda", representing both the mean and sd of a distribution, we are able to simulate and calculate probabilities of number of occurrences, such as points scored in a game by a player. However, to apply bayes theorem and get credible intervals, we need a continuous probability, enter the conjugate prior: gamma. We use this to perform bayesian updating and calculate credible intervals to give us insight on a new player to our pretend basketball team.

- [Episode 102: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Normal-Normal Conjugate](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep102)

  - This week we take a look at the most common, but also potential the most confusing distribution for our purposes - the normal distribution. We discuss how a bayesian looks at and uses a normal distribution, in where our mean and standard deviation both have their own distribution. An assumption is applied for us to work through a simple problem this week where we determine the probability of a basketball player being above average in a made up efficiency metric, and we demonstrate how to use bayesian updating as we gain new information on the player.

- [Episode 103: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Normal-Gibbs Sampler](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep103)

  - The final episode in this series on bayes, we use learnings from several prior episodes to apply a new technique, Gibbs Sampling. This tool is used when there are multiple parameters that are being evaluated, each with their own parameters. We continue with the example from last week, but demonstrate how we can use a Gibbs Sampler to generate a distribution without having set the mean and standard deviation for a players efficiency metric. We also show a simple function that applies what we have learned in a simple API.

- [Episode 104: R Classes and Objects - dates and POSIXt](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep104)

  - This week we go on a date. Well, we talk about a date. Okay, okay, we talk about how to look and use date and datetime objects in R. We start with a high level overview of object systems that exist in R, and then reach into our mailbag to answer a question about lubridate. We talk about the fundamentals of date and POSIXt type objects, and ways to use them. Then we go over some of the difficulties of their behavior and how the {lubridate} package really makes dealing with dates much simpler.

- [Episode 105: R Classes and Objects - Base](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep105)

  - In the past 104 episodes, we realized we never spent time going over the base object types in R, how to build them up, and access them. This is something we have done in every episode, but decided this was the week we go over the mechanics of how it all works. We use four base object types; boolean, integer, numeric, and character, and show you how to build vectors, matrices, and data.frames. We go over how we think about objects.

- [Episode 106: R Classes and Objects - Factors](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep106)

  - A common question until R4.0.0 was "why is stringsAsFactors TRUE by default" to many a new R programmer. In this episode we discuss the mysterious factor object that is in base R. Why does it exist, how do you use it, and how to work with it are questions we attempt to answer here. We demonstrate changing vectors to and from factors, how factors impact regression models, and how to use factors to generate plots!

- [Episode 107: R Classes and Objects - Lists, Part 1](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep107)

  - Listy, list, lists. This episode we talk about one of our favorite, most flexible objects in R, a list. These objects can do almost anything, because they just don't care. Ellis and Patrick talk about how to create lists, discuss how they can nest and contain different object types, extraction of contents, and iterating over them. They talk about the {purrr} package and the valuable `map` family of functions, compare them to some of the `apply` family of functions, and compare them to a list.

- [Episode 108: R Classes and Objects - Lists, Part 2](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep108)

  - Listy, list, lists. AGAIN. This episode we continue our talk about lists. Last week we showed some methods to create and work with lists, and this week we show a variety of ways that lists can be used. We demonstrate summary statistics gathering, recording model results, and even looping over a list to generate a PDF report!

- [Episode 109: R Classes and Objects - Making an S3 Object,  Part 1](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep109)

  - So far we have discussed the EXISTING objects included in base R. But our viewers may remember mention of additional object systems; s3, s4, RC, R6. In this episode we introduce the idea of making your own object in the S3 object system. Ever wonder how a tibble was made and how so many functions "just work" with it. Here we start to give you some insight to this idea by creating our own object and its own print method. Then we demo how you write a function to serve as a constructor of that object!

- [Episode 110: R Classes and Objects - Making an S3 Object - Part 2 - S3 Tournament](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep110)

  - We extend the idea of creating our own objects this week by demonstrating "s3 in practice". We pretend to be a Data Scientist for a a local sports betting company. The season has just ended for a local sports league. And we want to predict who will will the whole enchilada. First we need to sort out how we will simulate a single game. We create objects representing teams, and a series of functions to predict team performance and eventually a game winner!

- [Episode 111: Nate Latshaw, UFC Data, and data.table](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep111)

  - This week we are joined by the one and only Nate Latshaw. Nate is a software engineer and open source contributor, making amazing visualizations of UFC data in R. Some of Nates work includes a complex shiny app that has a lot of different ways to explore UFC fighter data. This week we are walked through how some of the visualizations are made, get a quick introduction to data.table, and get an inside look to how Nate creates such amazing visualizations. After the code, we talk about Nates career, experience in the open source community, and advice for those looking to start their own open works!

- [Episode 112: R Classes and Objects - Making an S3 Object - Part 3 - S3 Tournament](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep112)

  - This is the final episode on creating and applying s3 objects. We discuss some comments we recieved from viewers asking about why s3 objects vs a named list, and then get down to business to completing our single round elimination tournatent. We create an object to represent a matchup, then abstract up to a tournament round, and finally the full tournament.

- [TidyX Episode 113 | R Classes and Objects - Making an S4 Object - Part 1](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep113)

  - We move onto the next, and possibly one of the more divisive (is that possible?) object systems in R - the S4 sytem. This system takes the free-wheeling s3 object class and says no more. Everything must be clearly defined up front, from the content of your object to its methods. We discuss some basics of why we use objects before getting into the nitty gritty of creating a few objects using the s4 system. We create a "print" method to demonstrate how to create a custom method, and show how to make a constructor.

- [TidyX Episode 114 | camcorder R package](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep114)

  - We take a step away from R objects to talk about a package that Ellis has been developing for the past 2 years - camcorder. Ellis talks about why he wrote the package, the ideas behind it, and folks might find value in it. He walks through an example of how to use the package, and gives a few call outs for folks that have supported the project throughout its two years.

- [TidyX Episode 115 | R Classes and Objects - Making an S4 Object,  Part 2 - S4 Tournament](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep115)

  - We finally come back to talking about S4 objects this week and talk about how one might use an S4 object IRL. We look back and what we did for S3 objects and decide to use the same context but this time talk about how we would solve this problem in S4 instead of S3. We talk about creating new S4 generics and methods, and incorporate some view suggestions to create an object holding the results of a simulated game! We also open with a quick tangent to talk about an amusing thread by Danielle Navarro (https://twitter.com/djnavarro/status/1565515145488797696) on S3 chaos.

- [TidyX Episode 116 | R Classes and Objects - Making an S4 Object,  Part 3 - S4 Tournament](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep116)

  - This week we close out our s4 discussion by finalizing our code to simulate tournaments. we built up last week simluated games, but
now we simulate tournament rounds, create new s4 classes and methods, and ultimately simluate a tournament. We update how we were approaching calling the likely winner of a tournament to simulate a tournament 1000 times.

- [TidyX Episode 117 | Creating Participant IDs](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep117)

  - Ever wonder how you can use tidyverse tools to create unique identifiers for your experiment records? wonder no longer. This week we show you how to use the lesser known `cur_group_id()` function to get the group id number to serve as a participant ID. Then we demonstrate how you can also use joins, and finally discuss creating an index for grouping observations of the same participant using integer division!

- [TidyX Episode 118 | Windowing Functions with {zoo} and tidyverse](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep118)

  - What technology lets you see through a wall? Windows. This episode we take a look at the ever useful tidyverse and how we can perform windowing to calculate values across windows. We celebrate Albert Pujols hitting 700 career home runs by looking at his career home runs and perform examples of different windowing calculations. We show how these calculations can be used as part of your visualization to add context.

- [TidyX Episode 119 | Slice n' Dicing data with tidyverse](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep119)

  - This week we look at a common function we use to help us select random subsets of data in tidyverse - slice_sample. This function is the predecessor to sample_n and sample_frac, and allows us to quickly and easily grab n rows or a proportion of the data in a single line of code. We go over a few different arguments and set ups that people might use these functions!

- [TidyX Episode 120 | Working with columns in Tidyverse](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep120)

  - Selecting, renaming, and moving around columns around is an incredibly common tast for data scientists. So much so that there are loads of little helpers embeded into the tidyverse world to improve quality of life. This episode we highlight the use of some of these helpers, such as the starts_with, ends_with, matches, and where functions, along with super important functions such as relocate and rename to move around columns and rename them respecively. Finally, we close with going over the differences between the dplyr::pull function and the purrr:pluck function.
