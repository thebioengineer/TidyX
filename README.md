### Description

The goal of TidyX is to explain how R code works. We are focusing on explaining topics either we find interesting or submissions from our viewers. Historically we explained how submissions to the #TidyTuesday Project worked to help promote the great work being done there. 

In this repository, you will find copies of the code we've explained, and the code we wrote to show the concept on a new dataset.

To submit code for review, email us at tidy.explained@gmail.com

  - Looking back at ones code can show you just how far you have come. Sparked by a conversation between Ben Baldwin (@benbaldwin), Patrick and Ellis, this weeks episode is on code review and refactoring. Ben went into his past and has furnished a set of code for us to try to refactor. In the spirit of things, neither of us looked closely at the code ahead of time, and recorded our initial reactions and process of refactoring Bens code into a function that could be applied to multiple datasets!

  - This week we reflect back on the past year and combine techniques from multiple episodes. We scrape multiuple tables from the the hockey reference website, use regular expressions to clean and organize the data, and use for loops to determine the optimal pythagorean win exponent.  We visualize the data using several different techniques, like scatter and lollipop charts. We show some fun tools with regularizing values for linear regressions and how how to predict and visualize the results.

  - This week we play with a new technique for optimizing, the `optim` function! We scrape the 2019-2020 NHL season to generate power rankings for every NHL team and home-ice-edge. We can use this to then predict team winning probability! We then combine that with season summary data to generate a pretty GT table!

- [Episode 49: MLB Batting Simulations](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep49)
  
  - We continue looking at simulations this week, but this time for individual players. Using {Lahman}, we pull the 2019 MLB player batting stats, and visualize the stats using histograms and density plots. Next, to generate confidence intervals around their batting averages we use rbinom() combined with techniques from the {tidyverse} to make simulation easy. Finally we visualize the data using {gt} combined with {sparklines}.

- [Episode 50: MLB Batting Simulations](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep50)
  
  - Another MLB Batting episode. This time we use the James Stein Estimator (paper below) to apply a shrinkage estimate to player batting averages to get a "true" estimate, removing luck. Using {Lahman}, we pull the 2018 MLB player batting stats, and explain how to implement the estimator. Next, we compare estimates against the 2019 season. Finally we visualize the data using {gt}, using header spans, and cell styling. For the grand finale we combine this gt table with batting averages with plots using patchwork!.

- [Episode 51: Deploying Models with Shiny](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep51)
  
  - Sharing the results of a modeling effort is an important skill of any data scientist. However, just sharing the weights of each predictory is often not good enough to get buy in from stakeholders who are understandably skeptical of your results. Using the power of shiny, you can show your stakeholders exactly how your model interprets and then predicts the results. In this episode, we use the {palmerpenguins} package with {randomforest} to generate a model to predict the species of a new penguin.

- [Episode 98: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Sampling and Bootstraps](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep98)

  - `sample` is a fun and useful base R function that allows you to select a sample of n values from a vector at random. This has important implications to setting up bootstap sets to resample existing datasets. This week we go through the differences between simulation and resampling and how to do some simple set ups to resampling that will be the foundation to the next few episodes.

- [Episode 99: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Basic Bayes](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep99)

  - Applying what we have learned these last few weeks, we are ready for Bayesian Statistics and Bayes theorem! This week we work through the concept behind Bayes, and attempt to talk through it in more approachable terms. We then try to apply the theorem to a few different cases to help solidify our understanding.

- [Episode 100: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Beta Bayes](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep100)

  - Continuing our series on bayes, this week we learn about the conjugate prior of the binomial distribution, the beta distributions! Applying what we have learned about bayes theorem last week, we work through an example where we are trying to evaluate the performance of a basketball player in a drill where the average participant hits 65% of their shots, and this person hit 16 of 20. We discuss how to calculate some credible intervals, and update our analysis as we get more data on this player!

- [Episode 101: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Poisson/Gamma](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep101)

  - Ever wonder how you could estimate the probability of a rate? Well, enter the Poisson distribution. Armed with "lambda", representing both the mean and sd of a distribution, we are able to simulate and calculate probabilities of number of occurrences, such as points scored in a game by a player. However, to apply bayes theorem and get credible intervals, we need a continuous probability, enter the conjugate prior: gamma. We use this to perform bayesian updating and calculate credible intervals to give us insight on a new player to our pretend basketball team.

- [Episode 102: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Normal-Normal Conjugate](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep102)

  - This week we take a look at the most common, but also potential the most confusing distribution for our purposes - the normal distribution. We discuss how a bayesian looks at and uses a normal distribution, in where our mean and standard deviation both have their own distribution. An assumption is applied for us to work through a simple problem this week where we determine the probability of a basketball player being above average in a made up efficiency metric, and we demonstrate how to use bayesian updating as we gain new information on the player.

- [Episode 103: Sampling, Simluation, and Intro to Bayes - Normal-Gibbs Sampler](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep103)

  - The final episode in this series on bayes, we use learnings from several prior episodes to apply a new technique, Gibbs Sampling. This tool is used when there are multiple parameters that are being evaluated, each with their own parameters. We continue with the example from last week, but demonstrate how we can use a Gibbs Sampler to generate a distribution without having set the mean and standard deviation for a players efficiency metric. We also show a simple function that applies what we have learned in a simple API.

We start with a high level overview of object systems that exist in R, and then reach into our mailbag to answer a question about lubridate. We talk about the fundamentals of date and POSIXt type objects, and ways to use them. Then we go over some of the difficulties of their behavior and how the {lubridate} package really makes dealing with dates much simpler.

  - In the past 104 episodes, we realized we never spent time going over the base object types in R, how to build them up, and access them. This is something we have done in every episode, but decided this was the week we go over the mechanics of how it all works. We use four base object types; boolean, integer, numeric, and character, and show you how to build vectors, matrices, and data.frames. We go over how we think about objects.

  - A common question until R4.0.0 was "why is stringsAsFactors TRUE by default" to many a new R programmer. In this episode we discuss the mysterious factor object that is in base R. Why does it exist, how do you use it, and how to work with it are questions we attempt to answer here. We demonstrate changing vectors to and from factors, how factors impact regression models, and how to use factors to generate plots!

  - Listy, list, lists. This episode we talk about one of our favorite, most flexible objects in R, a list. These objects can do almost anything, because they just don't care. Ellis and Patrick talk about how to create lists, discuss how they can nest and contain different object types, extraction of contents, and iterating over them. They talk about the {purrr} package and the valuable `map` family of functions, compare them to some of the `apply` family of functions, and compare them to a list.

  - So far we have discussed the EXISTING objects included in base R. But our viewers may remember mention of additional object systems; s3, s4, RC, R6. In this episode we introduce the idea of making your own object in the S3 object system. Ever wonder how a tibble was made and how so many functions "just work" with it. Here we start to give you some insight to this idea by creating our own object and its own print method. Then we demo how you write a function to serve as a constructor of that object!

Some of Nates work includes a complex shiny app that has a lot of different ways to explore UFC fighter data. This week we are walked through how some of the visualizations are made, get a quick introduction to data.table, and get an inside look to how Nate creates such amazing visualizations. After the code, we talk about Nates career, experience in the open source community, and advice for those looking to start their own open works!

  - This is the final episode on creating and applying s3 objects. We discuss some comments we recieved from viewers asking about why s3 objects vs a named list, and then get down to business to completing our single round elimination tournatent. We create an object to represent a matchup, then abstract up to a tournament round, and finally the full tournament.

- [TidyX Episode 113 | R Classes and Objects - Making an S4 Object - Part 1](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep113)

  - We move onto the next, and possibly one of the more divisive (is that possible?) object systems in R - the S4 sytem. This system takes the free-wheeling s3 object class and says no more. Everything must be clearly defined up front, from the content of your object to its methods. We discuss some basics of why we use objects before getting into the nitty gritty of creating a few objects using the s4 system. We create a "print" method to demonstrate how to create a custom method, and show how to make a constructor.

  - We take a step away from R objects to talk about a package that Ellis has been developing for the past 2 years - camcorder. Ellis talks about why he wrote the package, the ideas behind it, and folks might find value in it. He walks through an example of how to use the package, and gives a few call outs for folks that have supported the project throughout its two years.

- [TidyX Episode 115 | R Classes and Objects - Making an S4 Object,  Part 2 - S4 Tournament](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep115)

  - We finally come back to talking about S4 objects this week and talk about how one might use an S4 object IRL. We look back and what we did for S3 objects and decide to use the same context but this time talk about how we would solve this problem in S4 instead of S3. We talk about creating new S4 generics and methods, and incorporate some view suggestions to create an object holding the results of a simulated game! We also open with a quick tangent to talk about an amusing thread by Danielle Navarro (https://twitter.com/djnavarro/status/1565515145488797696) on S3 chaos.

  - This week we look at a common function we use to help us select random subsets of data in tidyverse - slice_sample. This function is the predecessor to sample_n and sample_frac, and allows us to quickly and easily grab n rows or a proportion of the data in a single line of code. We go over a few different arguments and set ups that people might use these functions!

  - Selecting, renaming, and moving around columns around is an incredibly common task for data scientists. So much so that there are loads of little helpers embedded into the tidyverse world to improve quality of life. This episode we highlight the use of some of these helpers, such as the starts_with, ends_with, matches, and where functions, along with super important functions such as relocate and rename to move around columns and rename them respectively. Finally, we close with going over the differences between the dplyr::pull function and the purrr:pluck function.

  - This week we get into some data engineering problems provided by a viewer! Ellis and Patrick are provided some wide data that contains some *simulated* data of a few patients after surgery. Our job is to turn this into some useful long data based on what we were provided. Using tools from the last few weeks, we demonstrate how to use mutate, relocate, rename, pivot_longer and pivot_wider. We show to approaches, one using more advanced regex and pivoting tools to make the data useful.

  - Event-based time series data is a super common type of data. But it does come with some unique challenges. This week we talk through some techniques a person might use to explore and filter this data into something more useful. We simulate event data where three participants have N observations and at any one of these observations an event may occur. We calculate number of events, time between events, how to get n observations post each event, and how to grab observations from two named events!

- [TidyX Episode 123 | Criss Cross Apple Sauce - Crossing in Tidyverse](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep123)

  - Crossing vectors and dataframes to generate new data or compare existing data is a very common practice in data analysis. Whether generating values to allow you to grid search or comparing values, there are helpers in R to make this process much easier. The tidyr `crossing` function and its familiars make this process a piece of cake. We explore the behaviors of these functions and give an example of how they can be useful!

- [TidyX Episode 143 | For in for(loops)](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep143)

  - Decisions in your code set up impact how you can structure your code later on. Loops are a flow control that can have a massive impact on what you can do later on, so how you set up your loop has a strong impact on code readability. Ellis and Patrick explore 4 different techniques on how you can set up the seemingly simple for(i in x).

- [TidyX Episode 144 | Nested for loops for Simulation](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep144)

  - For loops are useful in a variety of different scenarios, but don't have to be restricted to just a single layer. Nested for loops allow you to iterate over muliple combinations of variables easily and quickly. In this episode we show how you might use a for loop to generate simulated data then apply three models to the newly simluated data to let you investigate your methods. We show where areas of this approach can generalize and be used for multiple data simulation and modeling techniques.

  - Our second episode on embedding statistical tests into a shiny app. This time we apply good practices to our model building by splitting the datasets into testing and training sets.  Using a slider, the user can select the proportion of data to split into their training set to create the model, and their test set that then they can evaluate the performance of the regression. We also add in some additional tabs to our shiny app to help prevent our users from becoming overwhelmed!

- [TidyX Episode 152 | Formula 1 Data Packaging - Getting the data](https://bit.ly/TidyX_152)

  - This week we start a series on building a data package! A data package is a great tool for you to be able to share versioned data with a variety of people very easily. It also is a great way to learn about package building concepts. Our data package will contain historical Formula 1 we have scraped from online resources. So this first episode in the series will focus on getting the data from a website using {rvest}. Finally, we close by showing how to make a fun plot of each years constructor champion as a waffle plot, coloring each tile with the average livery color of the team.

- [TidyX Episode 154 | Formula 1 Data Packaging - Documenting and Sharing](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep154)

  - Now that we have the rough shell of a data package with the minimum requirements, lets make into an honest-to-god, sharable and useful package. We do this in a few ways, first we document our packages using Roxygen to make man pages, update our DESCRIPTION to include the packages we use, and finally offer up a usecase for the data in a vignette! Join us as we talk through all these steps and how to do it!

- [TidyX Episode 155 | R Packages - Functions](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep155)

  - Our last series covered building a useful data package, but what about writing a normal package? This new series will be about writing an R package based on functions from TidyX! This episode we talk through a) what is a function b) how to think about a function and c) writing cohesive functions. 
  - [Source Code](https://github.com/thebioengineer/TidyX/tree/master/TidyTuesday_Explained/155-Functions)

- [TidyX Episode 156 | R Packages - Roxygenizing your Package](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep156)

  - Providing a minimum set of documentation for your package is made incredibly easy through the use of the {roxygen2} package. We write specially formatted comments, called roxygen blocks, before each of the functions we would like to document and voila we get our help pages! We discuss a number of basic roxygen tags to use and a few methods for approaching documentation!
  - [Source Code](https://github.com/thebioengineer/TidyX/tree/master/TidyTuesday_Explained/156-Custom_package_start)

- [TidyX Episode 157 | R Packages - Making an example of your Package](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep157)

  - For the most part our journey of package documentation is coming to an end, a user can see the functions, go to a help page, and see what should be entered into every argument. HOWEVER, thats still not enough! Remember, users are not you, they need ot see how a function should be used to get a better idea of the inputs and expected outputs. To that end, we show how to use the @examples tag and show some additional interesting roxygen tags like @seealso, @noRd, and how to link to other function documentation.

- [TidyX Episode 158 | R Packages - Write a vignette for yourself](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep158)

  - Now that our package functions are fully documented, our job as a package author is done, right? wrong. The next level is at least one vignette. A vignette is long form documentation included in your package to help folks understand not only how each function works, but how they can work together or how they can apply your package more generally. In this episode we show how to create, make and document your vignettes!

- [TidyX Episode 159 | R Packages - Feeling a little Testy](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep159)

  - Now that our package is documented, both at a function level and entire document, as well as containing data and useful functions, are we done? Well, by this video existing, you should answer NO! All of this is great, but how do we know that our functions are giving us correct answers and as we update or modify them they continue to behave as expected? Using the {testthat} package, we can write useful tests that get run as often as we'd like to confirm our expectations!

- [TidyX Episode 162 | Advanced Shiny - Web Scraping and Dynamic Linking](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep162)

  - Sometimes you need to dynamically pull content for your shiny app, since you don't have it all locally. This could be a database, internal API, and in our case, an external website. Using Hockey-Reference.com, we create a simple shiny application to allow us to get the list of games from a season and then pull game-level information such as scoring and penalites. Of course we want to give credit and allow our user to see more information, so we create a nice link back to hockey-reference.com that allows the user to go directly to the game page.
